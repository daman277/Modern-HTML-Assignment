    <h1>Key Features of HTML5</h1>
    <hr>
<ol>
    <li><b>Native Audio and Video Support:</b>
    <ul><br>
        <li>HTML5 introduced native <b>'audio'</b> and <b>'video'</b> 
            elements, which allow developers to embed audio and 
            video content directly into web pages without relying 
            on third-party plugins like Flash. This native support 
            eliminates the need for additional browser extensions 
            and improves the overall user experience by providing 
            a standardized way to include multimedia elements.</li>
    </ul></li><br>
    <li><b>Canvas Element for Graphics and Animations:</b>
    <ul><br>
        <li>The <b>'canvas'</b> element in HTML5 provides a 
            drawing surface for dynamic graphics, animations, 
            and interactive applications. Developers can use
            JavaScript to draw shapes, images, and animations
            directly on the canvas. This feature is particularly 
            valuable for creating web-based games, data 
            visualizations, and other interactive content, 
            offering greater flexibility and performance compared 
            to older methods.</li>
    </ul></li><br>
    <li><b>Local Storage (localStorage and sessionStorage):</b></li>
    <ul><br>
        <li>HTML5 introduced the localStorage and sessionStorage 
            APIs, which enable web applications to store data 
            on the client's device. Unlike cookies, which 
            have limitations in terms of storage capacity and 
            security, local storage provides a larger and more 
            secure data storage solution. It allows web 
            applications to persistently store data on a user's 
            device, making it accessible even after the browser 
            is closed or the session ends. This feature is useful 
            for creating offline web applications, caching data, 
            and improving the user experience by reducing the 
            need for repeated server requests.</li>
    </ul>
